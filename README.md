Hey, this is my first "game" made completely from scratch. it's meant to be a wave based shooter.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72a1f2c2-c334-4b77-b156-c3fdfcea4963)
I pulled some images off the web hope that's alright. Would love feedback on how to make my code more readable and any improvements on what to add to the game!

nice menu i added![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7176e7e-5389-42ed-9d22-71647371a1e4)
